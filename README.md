# ft_printf

The goal is simple, remaking a more concise and small version of the famous printf function.

Our printf had to manage "%c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X and finally %%".

Since it was one of the first projects, it was interesting to play with different formats, transforming strings into numbers, then back into strings, transforming numbers into their hexadecimal form, printing the address of a pointer, etc.
It made us think about integers, chars and pointers in another way.
